mention that mr tan has many business partners from all around the world
when he was in bali, he met up with mr ongko for leisure
mr ongko is an indonesian.

mr ongko spotted mr tan using udo, and likes the app
however the app on his computer only parses english
mr ongko asks if he can have an indonesian version
mr tan says there isnt one... yet!
we can make one ourselves, DIY!

he explains,
udo is open source,
when you get udo, you get the ability to change the inner workings of udo as well
but mr ongko doesnt know much about programming
he doesnt think he can contribute to open source

however open source is not just about the programming aspect
udo especially caters for language substitutability.
the language package is separated from the main codebase
this allows non-programmers to be able to contribute to the app as well

mr ongko is excited about this
so mr tan and mr onkgo work together in their free time to translate the app

after just two weeks, it's done.
now they have udo in a new language.
they also share their translation with the community.
they upload their translated language package onto the internet
